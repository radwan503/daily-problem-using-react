The sort() function in JavaScript is used to sort the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array. By default, the elements are sorted in ascending order. However, you can provide a custom sorting function as an argument to define your own sorting criteria.

▶ Why use sort() and when to use it:

sort() is incredibly useful whenever you need to organize elements in an array, especially when dealing with data that needs to be presented in a specific order. Whether it's numbers, strings, or complex objects, sort() provides a convenient way to arrange data according to various criteria. It's particularly handy in scenarios like generating sorted lists, implementing search algorithms, or arranging user-generated content.

▶ Example use of sort() using React:

In an e-commerce application built with React, consider a scenario where you have an array of products fetched from a database, and you want to provide users with the option to sort products by price, name, or alphabetical order.
