reduce() is a powerful method in JavaScript used to iterate through an array and accumulate a single result. It executes a provided function for each value of the array, resulting in a single output value. This method takes in a callback function and an optional initial value.

‚ñ∂ Why use reduce():
reduce() is particularly useful when you need to perform a computation on an array and consolidate the results into a single value. It can simplify code and make it more expressive by condensing operations that involve iterating over an array and performing some kind of calculation or transformation.

‚ñ∂ When to use reduce():

1Ô∏è‚É£ Aggregating Data: When you need to compute a single value from an array of values, such as finding the sum, average, maximum, or minimum.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Transforming Data: When you want to transform an array into a different data structure, such as converting an array of objects into a single object or array.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Flattening Arrays: When you need to flatten an array of arrays into a single array.
