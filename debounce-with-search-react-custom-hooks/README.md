‚ñ∂ Debounce with Search
Debouncing is a technique used to limit the rate at which a function is invoked. In the context of search functionality, debounce can be incredibly useful. When a user types into a search bar, it triggers a function to update the search results. However, if this function is invoked every time a keystroke occurs, it can lead to performance issues, especially if the search involves fetching data from a server.

Debounce works by introducing a delay before invoking the function. When the user types, the function is not immediately executed. Instead, debounce waits for a specified amount of time (the debounce period) to pass after the last keystroke before executing the function. If another keystroke occurs within this period, the timer resets. This ensures that the function is only called once the user has stopped typing, reducing unnecessary calls and improving performance.

‚ñ∂ Why Use Debounce:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Performance Optimization: By reducing the number of function calls, debounce helps improve the performance of search functionality, especially in cases where there's network latency involved.

2Ô∏è‚É£ User Experience: Debounce creates a smoother user experience by preventing rapid updates to the search results while the user is still typing. It allows the user to finish typing before displaying the results.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Reduced Server Load: Debounce helps reduce the load on the server by batching requests. Instead of sending a request for every keystroke, it waits until the user pauses typing, then sends a single request with the final search query.
